He had multiple shops and became largely a trade printer, working with several of the publishers of that time. His first book entry occurs in the Registers on August Ist, 1586 [Arber, i. 450]. While his first prints consist mostly of ballads, he soon was able to print the works of famous writers such as Thomas Churchyard, Samuel Daniel, Thomas Dekker, Christopher Marlowe, John Taylor, and many other. In 1597, he had his press seized by the Company of Stationers after publishing a Catholic confession, but was able to resume his business under the influence of the Archbishop of Canterbury. He had judicial problems again in 1599 for printing books that had been censured and ordered to be burnt. After his death, his wife continued the printing business for a couple of years. </span></li><li><span class="persName">William Wright </span>Bookseller<span class="note" id="Note2"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>He was a senior bookseller in London, the son of a carpenter, Matthew Wright of London. His first book entry in the Registers on July 1579. His printing focused in ballads, broadsides, news books and other genres of ephemeral literature. He firmly opposed the monopolies of printing privileges, and was imprisoned in the Counter for books he had not been granted authorization to print.</span></li><li><span class="persName">John Fian </span>School teacher<span class="note" id="Note3"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>John Fian or Fean, Johnne Sibbet alias Cunninghame, and John Cunningham. His dittay was the first, and it incriminated Robert Grieson, Michael Clark, and Agnes Sampson, who he claimed to have seen at the North Berwick kirk. According to Newes, he was a young man at the time, and he had an elaborated narrative of how the devil approached to him. He is said to have experienced trances and extracorporeal travel. At his execution, he supposedly confessed to adultery with 32 women, but denied witchcraft, attributing his fantastic previous statements as strategic to save him from torture.</span></li><li><span class="persName">King James I </span>King of Scotland and England<span class="note" id="Note4"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>James I of Britain or James VI of Scotland became King after the death of Elizabeth I. He was the son of the executed Queen of Scots. Years after the case of the Berwick Witches - which according to Newes had as a major goal harm him - he wrote a demonological tract, Daemonologie, in the form of a dialogue with a sceptical interlocutor. He also paricipated actively in the examinations of the North Berwick accused, and seemed to be obsessed with the potential influence of evil supernatural forces on earth, especially for the crown.</span></li><li><span class="persName">David Seaton </span>deputy bailiff<span class="note" id="Note5"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>David Seton or Seaton, deputy Bailliff of Tranent, dweller in the Seton house. He was responsible for examining Geilis Duncan. Catholic who opposed the expansion of Protestantism in Scotland, as well as other members of the Seton house, under Lord Robert Seton. The Setons had important connections with both Mary Queen of Scots and James I.</span></li><li><span class="persName">Geillis Duncane </span>house maid at David Seton's<span class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Maid at the house of Seaton, who suspected of her activity of going out of home late at night. She was accused of performing miraculous things not described at Newes. She was the first accused in the North Berwick trials and she incriminated Agnis Sampson under torture, after being searched for "the devil's mark".</span></li><li><span class="persName">Agnis Sampson </span>Cunning woman, healer and midwife<span class="note" id="Note7"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Agnis was known in the community for her healing and midwifery services.

Upper-class woman, wife of Patrik, Makcalyane (alias Moscrop) who lived in Cliftonhall. In her trial she was accused of trying to kill her husband and other family members for political gain, and for consulting with lots of witches. She was burned alive on the castle hill, on June 25th 1591.</span></li><li><span class="persName">Barbara Naper </span>Upper-class woman<span class="note" id="Note11"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>Barbara Naper (or Napier) was one of Agnes's higher status clients—which later led to her implication. At a later stage Geillis also seems to have implicated Euphame MacCalzean, Seton's own much richer sister-in-law. There is some evidence that family tension may have led to this accusation; perhaps it was done in the hope of seizing Euphame's considerable estates of Cliftonhall. It is about these two high-status female accused witches that we know most. </span></li><li><span class="persName">Douglas Archibalde </span>8th Earl of Angus, privy councillor and sheriff of Berwick and lieutenant general of Scotland.<span class="note" id="Note12"><span class="noteLabel">Note: </span>His influence stretched beyond Berwick and as a presbyterian (aligned with Elizabeth I), he fled to Newcastle, a center of Presbyterianism, where he felt safe against the rule of the Scottish government.
